## *The Architecuture*

In this project we use MVVM. Our **View** requests to our **Service** any information then our **Service** requests to our **API** or **Repository** that information, then they return to our service our **Model** 
finally our **Service** transforms that **Model**  into a **ViewModel** and returns to our **View**.

## *Third Party Libraries*

### RxSwift:
    
RxSwfit its a powerful library how offers an alternative to handle callback hell. It makes the code more functional and easy to understand and threat callbacks and errors. In this particulary project it was essencial to chain requests  in Marvel's Detail, without probaly my code would more extensive and dirty.

### Quick/Nimble:

QuickNimble its a layer between the native sintaxe and us, it makes Unit tests easier to write and read also similar to other unit tests of different programming languages such NodeJs. 


## *To my Farfetch reviewers:*

I didnt have time to code on this weekend then I had to run against time in this week to develop those user stories. My deepest regret are the user interface which I could make more prettier and more unit and interface tests. This challange is awesome! Definitely I will finish those things and keep it open source.  

Thank you for the challenge no matter the result I feel myself grateful!
