# **Alex's Mavel**

## *The Architecuture*

In this project we use MVVM. Our **View** requests to our **Service** any information then our **Service** requests to our **API** or **Repository** that information, then they return to our service our **Model** 
finally our **Service** transforms that **Model**  into a **ViewModel** and returns to our **View**.
